**ULE (Universal Linux Environment)**

This is a Linux distribution that aims to create a easy-to-use and universal experience and compatibility with other Linux distributions and Windows. We want to ensure that only the hardware architecture, computer brands, and user-installed software/theming have a difference on a user's experience.
